# CypressTask
Hello, at start I want to mention that I never used Cypress before doing this task and this work is result of 2 weeks of learning and writing code on weekends and after my work hours. I hope that it meets at least part of expectations.

To start tests using Windows PowerShell please move to file directory /CypressTask and use one of the commands:
npm run "cypress:run:" to run headless in electron
npm run "cypress:run:chrome:" to run headless in chrome
npm run "cypress:run:chrome:headed" to run headed in chrome

I was not sure about in which file type should I write test scenarios, but both of these scenarios are in pdf file type so please open these manually.

At the end of last test in createAccountTest.cy.js I implemented extra step to delete created user just to add usage of API
